\item We quantify cell deformation at the boundary by computing the dot product of the gradient of cell density, which is perpendicular to the boundary, with the major axis of the nuclei true strain tensors, which correspond to their elongation axis. In accordance with observations, the dot product maps reproducibly show that nuclei are elongated in the direction of the boundary, i.e perpendicular to the gradient of cell density.

\paragraph{Large scale nematic order and tissue topology}

In the process of investigating changes in tissue structure and organization during gastruloid development, we study spatial heterogeneities in tissue physical properties and how patterns of these properties are variable from one sample to another. We illustrate the full approach on a single sample, and show that the results are reproducible across samples.\\
To probe quantities related to the tissue structure at multiple scales, we smooth their signal with a Gaussian kernel of width $\sigma$, with $\sigma$ defined as the spatial scale of interest.
We first quantify nuclei packing and cell deformation in the tissue. The example. From the segmented nuclei instances, we compute fields of cell density (number of cells per unit volume), nuclear volume fraction (ratio of nuclear volume to local neighborhood volume), and nuclear volume at multiple scales.
We plot each field on Fig. \ref{FIG3} at three spatial scales ranging from the nuclei scale, i.e $\sigma$ set to the average nuclear radius, to the tissue scale, i.e $\sigma$ set to six times the average nuclei radius.
The cell density field reveals a high level of heterogeneity at the nuclei scale, at which the central cavity present in the sample is visible as a region of low cell density.
All analysis scales show the presence of two tissue-scale populations of cells of low and high densities, separated by a sharp boundary characterized by the lengthscale of a few nuclei.
The two populations and the boundary are also visible, although less clearly, from the nuclear volume and nuclear volume fraction fields, with the high-density population showing a higher nuclear volume fraction but lower nuclear volumes.
The nuclear volume fraction indicates regions of high packing located in the high-density population, with a maximum of 61\%, close to the theoretical value for random close packing of spheres (64\%). 
As the sample contains few cavities, this indicates high nuclei to cell volumes ratios, which suggests that nuclei shapes are a good proxy for cell shapes, and thus nuclei could be relevant in cell-scale mecanotransduction studies.\\

To quantify cell deformation, we first compute the inertia tensor from each segmented nuclei instance and normalize it with respect to the nuclei volume to get their true strain tensor. This justifies averaging these tensors among nuclei with large size variations by effectively removing the size bias. We plot the major axis (associated with the largest eigenvalue) of the true strain tensor for each nuclei on Fig. \ref{FIG3} at the nuclei scale. The major axis is oriented along the direction of the largest deformation of the nuclei. Close to the low-to-high density boundary, we observe that nuclei are elongated in the direction of the boundary, i.e perpendicular to the gradient of cell density. 
We further quantify this observation by computing the angle $\theta$ between the gradient of cell density and the major axis of the true strain tensors. 
We plot on Fig. \ref{FIG3} the continuous field representing the quantity $\cos^2 \left( \theta \right)$ at the tissue scale. 
For random orientations of the major axis with respect to the gradient of cell density, the average value of $\cos^2 \left( \theta \right)$ is $1/3$, and the value approaches 0 or 1 for respectively perpendicular and parallel orientations. 
The field reveals a wide region with values below 0.15 around the boundary, confirming that nuclei are elongated in the direction of the boundary. 
These descriptions appear reproducibly in several samples, see Fig. \ref{FIG3_SUPP}.
This observation is consistent with an interpretation of the boundary as a region of high mechanical stress, and is reminiscent of effective behavior of cells in models of fluid-solid mixing.\\

This analysis shows how nuclei shapes at small scales are appropriate proxy for deformation, nematic order inside and around tissue micro-structures like lumen and cavities, which allows for accurate description of the local epithelial architecture. At the tissue scale, nuclei shapes can serve as a proxy for tissue mechanical stresses in the context of tissues as visco-elastic liquids with residual elasticity in cell deformation.
